must haves:
- parallax background with google earth images
- "interact" with background for health/weapon pickups
- player controls done through physics, not faked.
- combat against enemy spaceships
- defend landmarks
- minimap
- shadows below enemies and player to simulate height above ground
- simple AI
- simple animations

nice to haves:
- varying difficulty levels
- weather effects
- lighting
- power up to slow down time/enemies
